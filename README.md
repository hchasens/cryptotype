    RSA Key Generation
    Encryption and Decryption functions
    Server that creates a new handler on a thread for every connection
    Send function

ToDo:
    Handler function for each connection
    Putting the parts togeather (I have most of the part, I just need to assemble them)
    Menu (I'd like some nice menu where the user can start and stop services and change settings. It's not a priority tho)
